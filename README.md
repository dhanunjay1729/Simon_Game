### **How to Play the Simon Game:**

1. **Start the Game:**
   - Click on any of the four color buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) to begin the game. 
   - The game will generate a sequence of lights and sounds, starting with the color of the button you clicked.

2. **Watch the Sequence:**
   - After you click the first button, the game will light up a random button along with its corresponding sound.
   - Your goal is to memorize the sequence.

3. **Repeat the Sequence:**
   - Click the same button that lit up in the same order to match the sequence.
   - After you input the correct button, the game will add another color to the sequence. For example, after "red," the next sequence could be "red, blue."

4. **Continue Repeating the Sequence:**
   - Each time you correctly input the sequence, the game adds another step, and you need to replicate the full sequence in order.
   
5. **Game Over:**
   - If you click the wrong button or fail to follow the sequence correctly, the game ends. You can restart by clicking a button to start a new sequence.

### **Winning Condition:**
- The goal is to continue replicating the sequence as long as possible, testing how far your memory can go.
